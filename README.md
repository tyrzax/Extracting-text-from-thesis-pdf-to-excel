# Extracting-text-from-thesis-pdf-to-excel
The intend of this project is to help the Department of Foreign Literature from Zhejiang University to build a database based on their archives of journal PDFs in Chinese. This project is started based on six journals from 2000-2019: 《当代外国文学》, 《俄罗斯文艺》, 《国外文学》, 《外国文学研究》, 《外国文学评论》, and《外国文学》.

The goal is to extract thesis titles, author names, affiliated institutions, abstracts, keywords, the studied author name, the nationalities of the studied author, funding program, the method of the studying, journal titles and the issue of the journal. Then put them in an Excel sheet in respective columns. If there is no such information then it will not be recorded.

This little project is possible with the help and advices of **Yuqing Ye** and **Yifei Li**, the Master's students at Zhejiang University.
